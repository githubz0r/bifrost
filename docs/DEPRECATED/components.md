# Components

For now components are best described in their config.yaml which is also parsed for requirements and outputs generated. This document will be updated with further explanations of each over time

## cgeMLST
**WARNING** currently the pipeline does not have a proper installation set up as kma and cgeMLST are not installable via conda. When we create docker images this won't be an issue but currently if you want to use this component the programs have to be installed and available in your path.
