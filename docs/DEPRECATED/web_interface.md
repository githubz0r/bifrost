(Text instructions below)

- Go to the run checker
- Load your run
- Check which samples and which components for those samples you want to rerun.
- Scroll down the page to the "rerun components"
- Enter the sample and the components you want to rerun and click submit
- Everything will try to run at the same time if possible, so if you have 
  components with dependencies you should submit them after the ones they
  depend on are finished.
